            <h3>Vertex Ridge FD RX7 D1 Project by A'pexi</h1>
            <time datetime="2024-06-07">Published on: June 7, 2024</time>
            <p>Category: Cars, Drift</p>

            <p>The D1 Professional Drift championship began in the year 2001. Since then, it saw huge improvements as famous tuning houses joined the series backing drivers. 
              Youichi Imamura, one of them, began driving as an entrant for the team "A'PEXi" in the second season of the D1GP in the bright yellow Toyota Altezza. However, 
              his performance was less than ideal as he couldn't even make it past qualifying in the first three rounds. This is a sheer contrast to his performance from last year, 
              where he managed to secure 2nd place in the championship with as much as one win in hand.
              The APEXi FD3S RX-7 made its debut in the D1GP in the year 2002 as a replacement for his Toyota Altezza which was underperforming.</p>

            <p>Immediately, it became a threat in the following rounds, proving how good of a weaponry the FD3S was, especially in the hands of Imamura. Walking up the brackets, 
              he secured two wins in that season with the RX7. (Tsukuba and Nikko) 
              Somehow upping that fantastic debut season, he managed to secure two wins again in the following year 2003, which was enough for him to secure the D1GP championship.</p>

            <p>Most D1GP cars in those days were not only competition cars but also showcases of company products. The beautifully plastered RX7 was no different. 
              It was equipped with various A'pexi engine, suspension, and exhaust parts such as N1 dampers and powerFC ECU. Not only that, but they also partnered
              with other companies to showcase Aero kits and wheels, such as Vertex for the Vertex Ridge Aero kit and Gram lights for the 57pro wheelset. 
              In the following years, the car underwent minor changes such as small livery bits and wheel changes and remained at the top of the grid finishing third in both 2004 and 2005.
              After that Imamura and the Apexi RX7 parted ways as he joined ORC with Top Secret for the 2006 season in a new Top Secret built FailrladyZ.</p>
