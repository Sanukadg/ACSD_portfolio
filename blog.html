            <h3>Vertex Ridge FD RX7 D1 Project by A'pexi</h1>
            <time datetime="2024-06-07">Published on: June 7, 2024</time>

            <p>The D1 Professional Drift championship began in the year 2001. Since then, it saw huge improvements as famous tuning houses joined the series backing drivers. 
              Youichi Imamura, one of them, began driving as an entrant for the team "A'PEXi" in the second season of the D1GP in the bright yellow Toyota Altezza. However, 
              his performance was less than ideal as he couldn't even make it past qualifying in the first three rounds. This is a sheer contrast to his performance from last year, 
              where he managed to secure 2nd place in the championship with as much as one win in hand.
              The APEXi FD3S RX-7 made its debut in the D1GP in the year 2002 as a replacement for his Toyota Altezza which was underperforming.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Immediately, it became a threat in the following rounds, proving how good of a weaponry the FD3S was, especially in the hands of Imamura. Walking up the brackets, 
              he secured two wins in that season with the RX7. (Tsukuba and Nikko) 
              Somehow upping that fantastic debut season, he managed to secure two wins again in the following year 2003, which was enough for him to secure the D1GP championship.</p>

            <p>Most D1GP cars in those days were not only competition cars but also showcases of company products. The beautifully plastered RX7 was no different. 
              It was equipped with various A'pexi engine, suspension, and exhaust parts such as N1 dampers and powerFC ECU. Not only that, but they also partnered
              with other companies to showcase Aero kits and wheels, such as Vertex for the Vertex Ridge Aero kit and Gram lights for the 57pro wheelset. 
              In the following years, the car underwent minor changes such as small livery bits and wheel changes and remained at the top of the grid finishing third in both 2004 and 2005.
              After that Imamura and the Apexi RX7 parted ways as he joined ORC with Top Secret for the 2006 season in a new Top Secret built FailrladyZ.</p>

              <h3>The Evolution of Web Development: Embracing HTML5 and Modern Frameworks</h3>
              <time datetime="2024-10-29">Published on: Oct 29, 2024</time>
              <p>Category: Web Development, Hobbies</p>

              <img src="images/webdev.webp" alt="web development image">
              <p>In the fast-paced world of web development, staying updated with the latest technologies is crucial. Among the significant advancements is HTML5,
                which has transformed the way developers create websites and web applications. Alongside this evolution, modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular have emerged,
                providing powerful tools for building dynamic user interfaces.</p>
              <h5>What is HTML5?</h5>
              <p>HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, the backbone of the web.
                Released in 2014, HTML5 introduced a range of features that improved multimedia integration and semantic markup. 
                Some key benefits of HTML5 include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Multimedia Support:</strong> HTML5 allows developers to embed audio and video directly into web pages using 
                  audio and video tags without relying on third-party plugins like Flash.</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic Elements:</strong> HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as header, footer, 
                  article, and section that help define the structure of a web page more clearly, improving accessibility and SEO.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Forms:</strong> HTML5 brought new input types and attributes, such as date, email, and placeholder,
                  which enhance form validation and user experience.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>The Rise of JavaScript Frameworks</h5>
              <p>While HTML5 provides the foundation for web content, modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular 
                have revolutionized how developers build interactive user interfaces.</p>
              <h5>React</h5>
              <p>Developed by Facebook, React is a component-based library that allows developers to create reusable UI components.
                Its virtual DOM enhances performance by efficiently updating only the parts of the web page that change. React's declarative 
                nature simplifies the process of building complex user interfaces, making it a favorite among developers for single-page applications (SPAs).</p>
              <h5>Angular</h5>
              <p>Angular, developed by Google, is a full-fledged framework that provides a robust platform for building dynamic web applications.
                It uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which adds static typing and powerful tooling capabilities. Angular offers features like 
                two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a comprehensive routing system, making it suitable for large-scale applications.</p>
              <h5>Why Choose a Framework?</h5>
              <p>Using frameworks like React and Angular can significantly speed up the development process.
                They come with built-in tools and libraries, promoting best practices and reducing the amount of boilerplate
                code developers need to write. Moreover, they help maintain a clean and organized codebase, making collaboration 
                easier in team environments.</p>
